<p>In this workshop, we will be introducing the paradigm of “functional” programming:<br />
a programming style that is built upon the idea of composing mathematical functions<br />
(note, not necessarily the same as programmatic). In essence, functional languages<br />
provide ways to write small, modular pieces of code that can be composed together<br />
to solve complex problems.</p>
<p>In addition to its close ties to theoretical math, it is also an incredibly useful<br />
skill that makes certain difficult problems much easier to solve! For instance, it<br />
obviates the need to track array indices, and it is commonly used in tasks such<br />
as data cleaning and analysis.</p>
<p>This workshop will be a code-along demonstration, covering some of the main ideas<br />
at the core of many functional languages. No background is necessary, as we will<br />
cover the concepts from the ground up. But, some familiarity with at least one<br />
programming language helpful!</p>
