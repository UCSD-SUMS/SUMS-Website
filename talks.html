    <h1>Talks</h1>
    <p>
      A lightning talk is a short presentation meant to quickly introduce a
      topic or concept to an audience. At SUMS, we host lightning talks
      related to mathematics and related fields and industries. In other
      words, if your talk is marginally related to math, we'd love to
      host your talk!<br>
      <br>
      Our lightning talks typically last anywhere between 15 minutes and an
      hour. Anyone can give a lightning talk, including, but not limited to,
      undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff. Like almost
      all of our events, attendance is open to the public.
    </p>

    <h3>Past Talks</h3>
    <h5>2018–2019</h5>
    <div class="title">Rudimentary Game Theory</div>
    <div class="speaker">Daniel Lee | Jan 23, 2019</div>
    <p class="description">
      Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic settings where
      the behavior of one player affects the other. Game theory has
      applications in many fields of social science and can be a useful
      tool for analyzing decision-making of rational groups and
      individuals. Games can range from simple, recreational games like
      tic-tac-toe, to more complex games like the Cournot and Bertrand
      duopoly models in economics.
      This talk will introduce basic concepts of game theory and examples
      of different games, in particular, the prisoner's dilemma and the
      rationalizability of cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Teaching Elementary Mathematics</div>
    <div class="speaker">Krystopher Weeton | Oct 30, 2018</div>
    <p class="description">
      A talk about the methods used to teach mathematics to students in
      elementary school. Topics range from addition of number under ten,
      through factors and multiplication strategies. Focus is on
      elementary strategies, and how to communicate these strategies to
      younger students.
    </p>

    <h5>2017–2018</h5>
    <div class="title">Homotopy and the Hopf Fibration</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Jun 4, 2018</div>
    <p class="description">
      Homotopy theory provides tools for studying topological spaces -
      roughly speaking, the homotopy groups πn(X) of a space X can be
      defined in terms of maps Sn → X from n dimensional spheres into it,
      yielding a method of “probing” a space for n dimensional holes.<br>
      <br>
      This talk will introduce some of the computational and theoretical
      tools used in homotopy theory. It will also cover some of the
      background needed to understand the Hopf Fibration, a map
      constructed by Heinz Hopf in the 1930s which wraps S3 around S2 in a
      nontrivial way. This has led to surprising consequences, including
      the existence of higher homotopy groups of spheres.<br>
      <br>
      (There will also be several visualizations that demonstrate the
      beautiful structure that emerges!)
    </p>

    <div class="title">Systems, Convolution, and Fourier Analysis</div>
    <div class="speaker">Eric Gelphman | May 20, 2018</div>
    <p class="description">
      We will first show how the response of an nth order linear system
      can be mathematically described by the operation of convolution by
      solving the ODE that describes the response of an nth order linear
      system using a Green’s Function. We will then go over how
      convolution can be transformed into multiplication by the Fourier
      and Laplace transforms. Finally, we will discuss applications to
      both electrical and biological systems.
    </p>

    <div class="title">To infinity and beyond, but why stop there?</div>
    <div class="speaker">Jonathan Lim | Mar 1, 2018</div>
    <p class="description">
      ”I can’t talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am
      not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers
      between 0 and 1. There’s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite
      collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of
      numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities
      are bigger than other infinities.” - John Green Although this
      argument may seem intuitive, when it comes to infinities, there are
      many times when our intuitions are wrong. In fact, the cardinality
      or the size of the interval [0,1], [0,2], and even [0,1,000,000] are
      all the same. Why is this true? Well come out to our next Lightning
      talk about cardinalities for a soft introduction to the puzzling
      idea of infinity and beyond!
    </p>

    <div class="title">Topological Fixed Point Theorems</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Mar 1, 2018</div>
    <p class="description">
      If you’re ever bored in Math class, try pulling out your calculator,
      putting in a random number, and then start hitting the cosine
      button. Before long, the digits will stop changing, which denotes a
      fixed point of the function. This idea generalizes to different
      kinds of maps and spaces, and using the tools of topology we can
      discover some counter-intuitive results about the world we live in -
      for example, can you ever truly mix a cup of coffee? And is it
      possible for two opposite points on a planet to have the exact same
      temperature and atmospheric pressure? These questions can be
      answered using the Brouwer Fixed-Point theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam
      theorem, which are the topics we’ll be discussing in this talk.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Homology and the Snake Lemma</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Nov 20, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      Homology is an algebraic tool that has proved to be useful in many
      areas of Mathematics, and in recent years has even been used in
      applied settings such as large scale data analysis.<br>
      <br>
      This talk is motivated by the movie “It’s My Turn” from 1980, which
      features an infamous scene involving a result known as “The Snake
      Lemma.” Surprisingly, this scene is mathematically precise, and is
      even referenced as a proof in a text by Weibel’s “Introduction to
      Homological Algebra”!<br>
      <br>
      The goal of this talk will be to provide a brief overview of some of
      the mathematics used in this scene, and ultimately to formulate what
      the Snake Lemma is and an example of how it can be used. In the
      process, we will also cover some of the basics of homology and its
      generalization in homological algebra.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Algebraic Geometry: A Historical Primer</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Oct 25, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      Algebraic Geometry is often touted as an abstruse, difficult to
      penetrate subject - however, these two branches of Mathematics have
      been intertwined since the time of the Greeks! In this talks, we
      will discuss Algebraic Geometry from a historical perspective,
      leading up to a brief, high-level modern overview of “the
      Nullstellensatz”, a theorem which provides a dictionary between the
      worlds of algebra and geometry.
    </p>

    <h5>2016–2017</h5>
    <div class="title">Boolean Fourier Analysis</div>
    <div class="speaker">Peter Amidon | May 26, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      Boolean Fourier Analysis has proven to be a remarkably versatile
      tool in various fields in theoretical computer science. In this talk
      I will introduce the basics of the technique and show how the simple
      change-of-basis that is Fourier analysis can solve many problems. In
      addition I will show a Fourier-analysis based proof of the famous
      Arrow’s Theorem which shows an approximate version of it: if a
      ranked-choice voting system has a high probably of choosing a
      Condorcet winner, then in some way it is “close” to being a
      dictatorship.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Vibrations on a Drumhead</div>
    <div class="speaker">Simon Hu | Apr 28, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      In this talk, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a
      drum-head. Specifically, we find an analytical solution to the wave
      equation in two dimensions by using Bessel’s functions.<br>
      <br>
      We first derive the Bessel’s function, which is a solution to a
      Second-Order, Linear, Ordinary Differential Equation. Then we
      discuss, shortly, the wave equation and the fundamental solution.
      Finally, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a drum-head.
      If time permits, we will discuss applications of this problem.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Brownian Motion</div>
    <div class="speaker">Kim Udomprapasup | Mar 17, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      This talk will discuss the mathematical theory of Brownian motion.
      We will begin with the description of Brownian motion, then move on
      to some of its interesting properties. Its connections to other
      areas in mathematics will also be mentioned, for example, harmonic
      analysis and PDE.<br>
      <br>
      If time permits, we will get a glimpse of stochastic calculus as
      well.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Introduction to Category Theory, Part 2</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Feb 24, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      Initial and terminal objects, products and coproducts, use of
      universal property in quotient and polynomial ring constructions,
      pullbacks/pushforwards, adjunction, monoids, monads.
    </p>

    <div class="title">The Galilean Group and Mechanics, both Classical and Quantum</div>
    <div class="speaker">David Moore | Feb 24, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      This talk will discuss the mathematical formulation of
      nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics. Both boil down to
      ordinary and partial differential equations, and both possess the
      galilean group as their symmetry group.<br>
      <br>
      We will start at the group and its corresponding Lie algebra,
      introduce the Poisson bracket (classical) and commutator (quantum),
      and derive some implications of the bracket + symmetry group laws.
      Throughout, we will stick as close as possible to differential
      equations, and ignore or tread around any functional analysis issues
      that crop up.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Category Theory as an Organization Tool</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Jan 27, 2017</div>
    <p class="description">
      This talk will continue some of the ideas introduced in last
      quarter’s talks on Category Theory. (We’ll also review some of the
      basics for people that didn’t make the first one.) The focus this
      time will be to see a number of examples of how Category Theory ties
      together various branches of branches of Mathematics.<br>
      <br>
      We’ll cover many of the structures seen in undergraduate classes
      like Analysis, Algebra, Combinatorics, and Topology, and how they
      are related to each other. I’ll also be explaining what the term
      “isomorphism” means in all of these contexts.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Math Jokes by Physicists: fractal dimension, random walks, the Ising model, and the continuum limit</div>
    <div class="speaker">David Moore | Dec 2, 2016</div>
    <p class="description">
      Efforts in statistical field theory - a physics subject similar to
      quantum field theory - are plagued with infinities. In this talk I
      will outline the path from fractals and self-avoiding random walks,
      to the Ising model and its ilk. This involves hilarities like the
      scrubbing away of infinities, limits as integers approach zero, and
      the path integral.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Matroids and Greedy Algorithms</div>
    <div class="speaker">Abel Mariam | Dec 2, 2016</div>
    <p class="description">
      There are a class of algorithms referred to as Greedy algorithms
      which are broadly characterized by the strategy of “picking what
      looks best at the moment”. It turns out that the theory of matroids
      provides the appropriate framework to partially characterize
      problems that have a greedy solution. A matroid, first introduced in
      1935 by Hassler Whitney, is a combinatorial structures that
      generalizes the notion of independence common in many different
      areas of mathematics.<br>
      <br>
      In this talk, I will introduce some basic definitions and results
      and discuss Matroid formulations of some classic problems in Graph
      Theory (Minimum Spanning Tree, Vertex Matching, and Interval
      Scheduling).
    </p>

    <div class="title">Haskell for Mathematics</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Sep 30, 2016</div>
    <p class="description">
      Basic of Haskell syntax and semantics, using examples from
      Mathematics. Topics: types, functions, lazy evaluation, partial
      application/currying, custom datatypes/records, common paradigms in
      functional programming (map/filter/reduce), overview of Prelude &
      Hackage.
    </p>

    <div class="title">Introduction to Category Theory, Part 1</div>
    <div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Sep 30, 2016</div>
    <p class="description">
      Motivation and history, basic definitions, examples of categories,
      overview of big ideas (commuting diagrams, universal properties,
      functors, naturality, duality, limits/colimits, Yoneda).
    </p>

    <div class="title">The Next Greatest Number</div>
    <div class="speaker">Matt Chan | Sep 30, 2016</div>
    <p class="description">
      Basics of point-free style programming (i.e. programming by function
      composition) and equational reasoning. How to derive a solution to a
      typical CS interview brain teaser by equational reasoning in
      Haskell, and how to transform the derived algorithm into an
      efficient one by calculation.
