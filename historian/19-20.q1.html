<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In Winter 2020, SUMS held 8 events, with 3 of them being workshops, and 1 being a Lightning talk.</p>
<p>In the second week on January 13, 2020, SUMS held itâ€™s Winter GBM. The officers introduced themselves, and then SUMS gave a presentation about what we do as a club (<a href="https://trello.com/c/aIA6JN8G/86-2020-01-13-winter-gbm">Trello</a>).</p>
<p>The next event took place on Friday, January 31, 2020 (Week 4). This event was our Winter Board Game night. Attendance was pretty high, and there was a good mix of graduate students, SUMS members, and non-members at the event. Overall, the event went very well (<a href="https://trello.com/c/byQhxaCs/89-2020-01-31-board-game-night">Trello</a>).</p>
<p>The next event took place on Wednesday, February 5, 2020 (Week 5). This event was the Intro to Upper Division Math Workshop and Peer Advising Q&amp;A. At this workshop, Our workshops Chair Yi Fu ran the event, and gave a presentation about core upper division math classes. We also had a panel of undergraduates who had taken a variety of upper division math courses. Students would ask questions about the courses, and members of the panel would answer (<a href="https://trello.com/c/BNRDPA2Z/93-2020-02-05-intro-to-upper-div-math-ws-peer-advising-qa">Trello</a>).</p>
<p>The next event was an R Workshop that was held on Thursday, February 13, 2020 (Week 6) (<a href="https://trello.com/c/DRrNm9OU/94-2020-02-13-r-workshop">Trello</a>).</p>
<p>The next event was a Math 31BH Review Workshop that was held on Thursday, February 20, 2020 (Week 7). The event was hosted by officer Fred Rajasekaran and staff member Arbi Leka. During the event, the hosts went over relevant practice problems and answered any questions from the 31BH students (<a href="https://trello.com/c/OMeBqlRu/95-2020-02-20-31h-study-session-1">Trello</a>).</p>
