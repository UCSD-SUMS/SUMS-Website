# 2018-2019: Summary of Quarter 2

## Summary

SUMS held 10 events during winter quarter including 4 workshops and 1 lightning talk (SUMS Drive).

The first event of the quarter was the Winter General Body Meeting on January 14th.
The event was used to inform both members and interested non-members about upcoming events SUMS would be holding during the quarter.
It also discussed how students could participate in the club in an official capacity ([Funding Request][gbm-funding-request]).
Notably, attendance was much greater than was expected due to a number of factors such increased growth and good weather ([PEEF][gbm-peef]).

On January 23rd, Daniel Lee gave a lightning talk on _Rudimentary Game Theory_ which discussed multiple examples of game theory's application including its ability to analyze a famous problem called the "prisoner's dilemma" ([Talk Slides][game-theory-slides]).

A \\(\LaTeX\\) Workshop was held on January 25th that covered tools which can be useful when writing scientific papers ([Trello][latex-trello]).

The second Board Game Night (BGN) of the year was held on February 1st and included various students playing and eating food provided by SUMS ([Funding Request][bgn-funding-request]).
The event helped students relax and get to know one another in a casual setting ([PEEF][bgn-peef]).

An _Advanced Integral Methods Workshop_ was hosted on February 6th ([Trello][aim-trello]).

A Team Building Event was held on February 16th.
Members of SUMS got together and went ice skating at the rink UTC ICE (Interest Form).

A highly anticipated event, SUMS hosted _Interview a Professor_ on February 19th with SUMS' Community Advisor, Jeffrey Saikali, interviewing UCSD Professor Todd Kemp ([Email to Kemp][iap-email]).
Students were given the opportunity to interact with a professor in a setting outside of official lectures/office hours.
Kemp was able to describe his experiences leading up to where he is today as well as what the last 10 years of his work at UCSD has been like ([Funding Request][iap-funding-request]).
Unfortunately, student attendance was significantly lower than expected due to a lack of publicity outside of SUMS ([PEEF][iap-peef]).

On February 22nd, SUMS hosted the _Math GRE Workshop_ which helped provide students with information about the _Graduate Record Examinations_' subject test which is commonly taken before applying to graduate school ([Trello][gre-trello]).

The last social event of winter quarter was a Movie Night where interested students watched _Fermat's Room_ together with food and snacks ([Funding Request][movie-funding-request], [Slack][movie-slack]).
This event also had significantly lower student attendance than was predicted ([PEEF][movie-peef]).

The last academic event was an _Intermediate Excel Workshop_ which covered topics such as shortcuts, text manipulation, and custom functions ([Trello][excel-trello]).
