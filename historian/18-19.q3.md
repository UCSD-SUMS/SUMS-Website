# 2018-2019: Summary of Quarter 3

## Summary

SUMS held 8 events during spring quarter with 2 of those events being workshops.

The first third of the quarter was generally empty of scheduled events with the first event not happening until April 26th.
This was a SUMS team building event where members went and had dinner together.
Afterwards, we bought boba at Ding Tea ([Sign Up Form][team-building-sign-up]).

The next event took place during week 5.
This was the _Intro to Upper-Div Math Workshop & Peer Advising Q&A_.
It provided students with preparatory information on what to expect when taking upper division math classes as well as giving them on opportunity to ask questions to and get answers directly from students with experience ([Trello][upper-div-trello]).

During week 6, SUMS coordinated with the Triton Actuarial Society ([TAS](mailto:tas.ucsd@gmail.com)) to hold the $\LaTeX$ WS.
The event provided students with an introductory sessions teaching them about basic tools to assist in writing papers using $\LaTeX$ ([Trello][latex-trello]).

On May 10th, SUMS hosted the third _Board Game Night_ of the year.
The event served "as an icebreaker" for our members ([Funding Request][bgn-funding]).
Similarly to last quarter, actual attendance was significantly less then predicted.
Overall however, the event went smoothly and the attendees enjoyed the event ([PEEF][bgn-peef]).

SUMS held its second _Interview a Professor_ event of the year on May 15th with Jeffrey Saikali as the interviewer and Professor Jacques Verstraete as the interviewee.
The event provided students the opportunity to listen to the experiences of professionals in their field ([Funding Request][iap-funding]).
Attendance was less than expected, however this may have been caused by the event being scheduled for midday ([PEEF][iap-peef]).

The next two events are linked together: the _Integration Bee Tryouts_ and the _Integration Bee_ itself.
Tryouts were held on May 24th in AP&M building.
Participants were given examinations that helped SUMS to determine a more concentrated list of contestants for the real event ([Trello][bee-tryouts-trello]).
The _Integration Bee_ consisted of 16 contestants competing against one another by computing integrals on a chalkboard as quickly as possible.
After many rounds, the three contestants with the greatest speed and accuracy were awarded prizes ([Details][bee-details] & [Funding Request][bee-funding]).
`PEEF not finished`
Notably, the _Integration Bee_ required significantly more coordination and work on the part of multiple officers than most events ([Task List][bee-tasks]).

The last event of the year was, fittingly, the _End of Year Banquet_ held on June 5th.
Officers, graduating members, the club advisor, and an alumnus attended the event to "celebrate a successful year of SUMS via food, socialization, and a word from officers and graduating members" ([Funding Request][banquet-funding]).
